## REQUIRED SUBMISSION COMPONENTS

### 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

**What problem are you solving and why does it matter?**

Indonesia generates 68 million tons of waste annually, but only 12% is properly sorted and recycled (source: Ministry of Environment and Forestry, February 2023). In Surabaya alone, 25-30 million urban middle-class households produce 3-8 kg of valuable recyclable waste per month, yet this waste ends up in landfills or burned.

The problem matters because:

**Economic Loss**: Families lose potential income from recyclable materials worth $5-15 per household monthly. At scale, this represents $150-450 million in lost value annually across Indonesia's urban centers.

**Environmental Impact**: Waste in landfills produces methane (25x more potent than CO2) and leachate contamination. Burning waste releases toxic dioxins and particulate matter affecting air quality and public health.

**Infrastructure Gap**: Existing solutions fail to serve the market:
- Waste banks require families to travel 1-3 km away with unclear operating schedules
- No convenient doorstep pickup service exists for sorted recyclables
- Low compensation (often $0.50-1 per trip) doesn't justify the time and transportation cost

**Market Validation**: Our previous pilot with this concept won 1st place at a regional competition, demonstrating strong judge confidence in the solution's viability.

This creates a lose-lose situation: families want to recycle but lack infrastructure, while recycling facilities need consistent material supply but can't access household waste efficiently.

### 2. SOLUTION DESCRIPTION

**What is your solution and how does it work?**

PilahYuk is a digital platform that provides scheduled doorstep pickup of sorted recyclable waste, with instant monetary rewards and environmental impact tracking.

**Core Value Proposition**:
1. Fixed, predictable pickup schedule (weekly to daily depending on subscription)
2. Instant rewards via GoPay or mobile credit within 24 hours of pickup
3. Zero effort for users - waste is picked up from their doorstep
4. Transparent environmental impact reporting (CO2 saved, waste diverted)

**How It Works**:

**For Users:**
1. Download app or visit website (pilahyuk.vercel.app)
2. Select subscription tier:
   - Free: $0/month (2 pickups, basic tracking, base rewards)
   - Regular: $9/month (8 pickups, real-time tracking, 2x rewards)
   - Premium: $19/month (unlimited pickups, priority queue, 3x rewards)
3. Sort waste into provided categories: plastic, paper, metal, glass, organic, e-waste
4. Schedule pickup through app
5. Driver arrives at scheduled time, weighs waste with digital scale
6. Rewards automatically calculated based on verified market rates:
   - PET plastic (clear): Rp 4,500-6,000/kg
   - PP cups: Rp 8,000-9,500/kg
   - HVS paper: Rp 4,450-8,200/kg
   - Cardboard: Rp 3,000-5,500/kg
   - Aluminum cans: Rp 13,000-15,000/kg
7. Payment transferred to GoPay/mobile credit within 24 hours
8. View monthly impact report: CO2 saved, trees equivalent, waste diverted

**For Operations:**
1. Drivers collect waste from multiple households on optimized routes
2. Waste transported to our sorting facility
3. Professional sorting ensures quality meets factory standards
4. Bulk sale directly to recycling factories (no middlemen)
5. Higher margins enable sustainable unit economics

**Technology Stack**:
- Frontend: Next.js 16 with TypeScript for responsive web application
- UI: Tailwind CSS 4 for modern, mobile-first design
- Animations: Framer Motion for smooth user experience
- Current Status: Functional prototype demonstrating complete user flow
- Next Phase: Backend integration with Firebase, payment gateway (Midtrans), and admin dashboard

**Key Differentiators**:
1. **Convenience**: Doorstep pickup vs requiring travel to waste banks
2. **Reliability**: Fixed schedule vs uncertain availability
3. **Fair Compensation**: 45-65% material margins (verified Feb 2026 market data) allow better user rewards vs competitors' 20-40%
   - Our buying power: Direct factory partnerships in Rungkut/Sidoarjo industrial zones
   - Competitor constraints: Multiple middlemen reduce margins
4. **Gamification**: Points system, tier progression, and redemption options increase engagement
5. **Transparency**: Real-time tracking and impact reporting build trust
6. **Quality Control**: Professional sorting at facility ensures premium pricing from factories
