## ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CALCULATIONS

### CO2 Reduction Factors (Verified)
| Material | CO2e Saved per kg Recycled | Methodology | Source Date |
|----------|---------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| PET Plastic | 1.50 kg CO2e | Life Cycle Assessment vs virgin production | Feb 2026 |
| Paper/Cardboard | 0.94 kg CO2e | Avoided deforestation + energy savings | Feb 2026 |

### Impact Projections at Scale
**Scenario: 5,000 active users**
- Average: 5 kg recyclable waste/user/month
- Total: 25,000 kg/month = 300,000 kg/year = 300 tons/year

**Assuming 50% plastic, 50% paper:**
- Plastic: 150 tons × 1.50 = 225 tons CO2e saved
- Paper: 150 tons × 0.94 = 141 tons CO2e saved
- **Total: 366 tons CO2e saved annually**

**Tree Equivalent**:
- 1 mature tree absorbs ~21 kg CO2/year
- 366 tons = 366,000 kg ÷ 21 kg = **17,400 trees equivalent**

**Marketing Message**: 
"Every 5,000 PilahYuk users = removing emissions equivalent to planting 17,400 trees annually"
